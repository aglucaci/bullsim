This project contains modifications to the source code for the BULL simulator
    used in:
    
        Holder, Zwickl, and Dessimoz. "Evaluating the robustness of phylogenetic
            methods to among-site variability in substitution processes."
            Philos Trans R Soc Lond, B, Biol Sci (2008) 4013-4021


Most of the code was by Mark Holder or Tracy Heath.

Some code (as noted in the code) was taken from MrBayes (John Huelsenbeck and
    Fredrik Ronquist), and PAML (Ziheng Yang). Some of the code in MrBayes was
    originally written by David Swofford.
